# ThreeFold Token

ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold Network. 

The ThreeFold Token represents a unit of reservation of autonomous Internet capacity.

Internet capacity is the worlds fastest growing commodity, and the TFT is supported by this highly demanded, underlying economy of infrastructure and services called the ThreeFold Network. The Network is comprised of developers, farmers, and users from all over the world.

### Where to get TFTs
ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) can be bought from any of the ThreeFold Farmers, active digital currency exchanges or through users on our own native DEX. For more information please visit threefold.io

### Origin Story  

The ThreeFold Network launched live at the end of March 2018 and the first group of ThreeFold Founding Farmers, collectively agreed to sell Tokens at a price higher than the US $0.10 per Token for the first month. This ensured a Token launching price of $0.10 and a community driven, decentralized agreement of launch value.  

### Utility Driven

“Utility” driven means that the ThreeFold Tokens can be used to buy and sell the internet capacity and/or products and services on the ThreeFold Network. In this way, the Token’s value is supported by the economy of services.

The community will have access to all metrics of the ThreeFold Grid required to determine its economic value.

### Economic value

The ThreeFold Token value will be determined by market supply and demand, however, the underlying economic value that supports the Token economy has been designed to always be far greater then tokens issued, to insure there is tangible infrastructure deployed with the generation of each token. 

Given the nature of the issuance model, the number of tokens issued by the grid to the new farmers is always smaller than the amount of real capacity connected to the Grid.  Due to this fact, the amount of tokens required to support liquidity on the market is growing faster than the tokens available.

1. Hardware connected to the ThreeFold Grid by installing Zero-OS
2. Decentralized blockchain issues specific amount of ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) every month to the hardware owner to the wallet, specified wallet
3. Farmers can keep TFT for some time or sell to anybody else.
4. Anybody can buy TFT on an open market or directly from farmers
5. When somebody wants to run workloads on farmer’s hardware, to reserve capacity he should use TFT. After reservation, TFT goes back to the farmer.
6. Anyone can buy TFT on an open market or directly from a farmer.
