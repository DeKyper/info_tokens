In what follows you see all steps involved in Bob (the "initiator") buying **42 TFT** (ThreeFold Token) from Alice (the "participant"), paying with **10 ROC** (Rivine One Coin). This transaction is done using the **cross-chain atomic swapping** algorithm, documented [here](https://github.com/rivine/rivine/blob/master/doc/atomicswap/atomicswap.md).

The below requires:
- The **ThreeFold Chain client** (`tfchainc`) and the **Rivine Chain client** (`rivinec`) command lines tools
- Locally running ThreeFold and Rivine blockchain nodes, achieved by having the Chain daemons running in the background 
- Access to the ThreeFold Chain and Rivine Chain Explorers, here through the chain client command line tools

Soon, in an update to this documentation, we will show how to do the same using Bitcoin instead of ROC.

We start by creating aliases for the chain client command line tools.

First for the Rivine, respectively aliases for accessing the node of Rob, Alice and the Rivine Explorer:
```bash
alias roc1="rivinec --addr localhost:23110"
alias roc2="rivinec --addr localhost:23120"
alias roce="rivinec --addr localhost:23130"
```

And for ThreeFold, respectively aliases for accessing the node of Rob, Alice and the ThreeFold Explorer:
```bash
alias tft1="tftchainc --addr localhost:23210"
alias tft2="tftchainc --addr localhost:23220"
alias tfte="tftchainc --addr localhost:23230"
```

Then we go through following steps:
- [Bob checks his ROC wallet](#1)
- [Alice checks her ROC wallet](#2)
- [Bob creates a new ROC address for sending 10 ROC](#3)
- [Alice creates a new ROC address for receiving 10 ROC](#4)
- [Bob initiates the transaction for sending 10 ROC](#5)
- [Alice checks the transaction information](#6)
- [Bob checks his TFT wallet](#7)
- [Alice checks her TFT wallet](#8)
- [Alice creates a new TFT address for sending the 42 TFT](#9)
- [Bob creates a new TFT address for receiving the 42 TFT](#10)
- [Alice initiates a transaction to send the 42 TFT](#11)
- [Bob checks his TFT and ROC wallets](#12)
- [Alice checks his TFT and ROC wallets](#13)
- [Bob checks the block height of his ThreeFold blockchain node](#14)
- [Alice checks the block height of her ThreeFold blockchain node](#15)
- [Check the Explorer for the same information](#16)
- [After a while Alice checks again her TFT wallet](#17)
- [Bob also checks his TFT wallet](#18)
- [Bob checks the info received information from Alice, through the explorer](#19)
- [Bob checks his wallets](#20)
- [Alice checks her wallets](#21)
- [Bob claims the 42 TFT](#22)
- [Alice checks her wallets](#23)
- [Bob checks his wallets](#24)
- [Alice checks the Explorer in order to get the secret](#25)
- [Alice is now ready to receive the ROCs](#26)
- [Check the wallets of Bob](#27)
- [Check the wallets of Alice](#28)

## Alice checks the transaction information

Check how to do it:
```bash

Alice (roc2) agrees with the contract and can see it exists and is unspend!
She can also see that she has plenty of time to claim it (47+h).
Now we can move over to tfchain, where Alice will start as the participant.
Both parties will also have to share their addresses on this chain.
Alice (tft2) has for now 1000 TFT, while Bob (tft1) still has none.
After all, Bob wants to buy TFT...

- output is not yet used as an input, so not yet spend
- ...

Bob now claimed these tokens, he is a bit mean though, and doesn't share the secret on the side channel... Is that it? Nope! Alice will just wait and than get the secret directly from ThreeFold Chain itself! Using an explorer...

Bob doesn't even need to give the outputID, Alice can do it all using her own outputID, take that Bob! Ha! What a mean guy, last time I do business with him!
