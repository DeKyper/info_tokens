## Registration and login

In order to use the ThreeFold app you need an [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) account. No worries in case you don't have an [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) account yet, just click the green **I AM NEW HERE** button that you see when you start the ThreeFold app for the very fist time, and  the ThreeFold app will guide you through the process of creating your [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) account.

In case you already have an [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) account, click the blue **I AM MEMBER** button, which will invite you to login with your [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) profile.

## Set your PIN code

After having associated your ThreeFold app to your ItsYou.online profile, your next step will be to set a PIN code, which you'll need later each time when you start the ThreeFold app, and access your ThreeFold wallet.

> **ThreeFold does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key. It is your personal responsibility to keep your 24-word private key in a safe place.**

> **Do not share your private key with anyone, it is strictly personal. Loosing your private key, means loosing access to your Wallet and all your ThreeFold tokens.**

> **Anybody with access to your private key can take ownership of your ThreeFold wallet and ThreeFold tokens**

> **In order to access your wallet from another wallet (on another phone or online) you will need your private key (seed), without this private key your account cannot be recovered on another device or online wallet.**
