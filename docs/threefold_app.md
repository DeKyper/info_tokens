# Using the ThreeFold App

ThreeFold created a ThreeFold app, available for iOS and Android phones. This ThreeFold app includes a ThreeFold wallet for safely keeping your ThreeFold tokens offline, and receiving and sending ThreeFold tokens from/to other offline and online wallets.  

> Currently the ThreeFold app only allows you to manage one single ThreeFold wallet at the same time, and only one wallet address.

Follow the steps below in order to setup your ThreeFold wallet, and receive and send your first ThreeFold tokens:

- [Registration and login](#iyo)
- [Set your PIN code](#pin)
- [Get your Private Key](#seed)
- [Receive tokens](#receive)
- [Send tokens](#send)
- [Transactions](#transactions)
- [Buying ThreeFold tokens using BTC-Alpha](#btc-alpha)

## Registration and login

In order to use the ThreeFold app you need an [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) account. No worries in case you don't have an [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) account yet, just click the green **I AM NEW HERE** button that you see when you start the ThreeFold app for the very fist time, and  the ThreeFold app will guide you through the process of creating your [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) account.

In case you already have an [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) account, click the blue **I AM MEMBER** button, which will invite you to login with your [ItsYou.online](itsyou.online) profile.

In both cases your ThreeFold app will be associated with your ItsYou.online profile.

## Set your PIN code

After having associated your ThreeFold app to your ItsYou.online profile, your next step will be to set a PIN code, which you'll need later each time when you start the ThreeFold app, and access your ThreeFold wallet.

## Get your Private Key

After having set your PIN code, a private key will be created for you. This key is a unique combination 24 words, also referred to as a **seed**. 

In order to access your private key, click **Settings** in the app menu:

We recommend making a screenshot of this screen, print it on paper and store it safely offline.

> **ThreeFold does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key. It is your personal responsibility to keep your 24-word private key in a safe place.**

> **Do not share your private key with anyone, it is strictly personal. Loosing your private key, means loosing access to your Wallet and all your ThreeFold tokens.**

> **Anybody with access to your private key can take ownership of your ThreeFold wallet and ThreeFold tokens**

> **In order to access your wallet from another wallet (on another phone or online) you will need your private key (seed), without this private key your account cannot be recovered on another device or online wallet.**

## Receive tokens

In order to acquire ThreeFold tokens you have basically two options:
- Buy them on a public cryptocurrency exchange, such as BTC-Alpha, as documented here below in [Buying ThreeFold tokens using BTC-Alpha](#btc-alpha), and then transfer them from your online TFT wallet at BTC-Alpha to your offline ThreeFold app TFT wallet
- Or receive ThreeFold tokens from someone who sends them to you from their online or offline TFT wallet, as documented here below in [Send tokens](#send)

For both cases you need your offline TFT wallet address, which you can lookup in the ThreeFold app by navigating to your wallet from the navigation menu, and then clicking the **Receive** button:

![Receive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/wallet-receive-300.jpg "Receive")

Here you see the TFT wallet address in two formats:
- As a QR code, which can be scanned from the wallet app of the sender, as documented here below in [Send tokens](#send) 
- Or in full text format, which can be copied by clicking it, and then paste the address into a chat or email message.

## Send tokens

Also sending ThreeFold tokens is simple. First navigate to your wallet from the ThreeFold app navigation menu, and then click the **Send** button:

![Send](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/wallet-send-300.jpg "Send")

In order to specify TFT wallet address of the receiving party you have two options:
- Either scan the QR code from the sender
- Or enter (copy/paste) the full text address 

Next to the recipient address, enter the amount to send, and you're ready to go. 

> Current transaction fee is 0.1 TFT.

## Transactions

Next to receiving en sending tokens, your TFT wallet also keeps track of all your transactions, and your balance of course.

To see your balance click **Transactions** in your wallet:

![Transactions List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/wallet-transaction-list-300.jpg "Transactions List")

Under the number of ThreeFold tokens you own (your balance) you see all (send and receive) transactions. Clicking any of the transactions will show you all details of the transaction:

## Buying ThreeFold tokens using BTC-Alpha

Next to receiving ThreeFold tokens from other ThreeFold app users, as documented [above](#receive), you can of course also buy ThreeFold tokens on public cryptocurrency exchanges, such as BTC-Alpha, which is actual the first one that offers ThreeFold tokens. See [Using BTC-Alpha](/how_to_buy/btc-alpha.md) for instructions on how to use BTC-Alpha. 

A list of all public cryptocurrency exchanges that offer ThreeFold is available from within the ThreeFold app. You can access this list by clicking **Exchanges** from the ThreeFold app navigation menu:
