# How To Use Mobile Wallet

## Registration and Log In
For the first use of the wallet, you will have to register your account. You will get account on [Itsyou.online](Itsyou.online) identity portal.
If you need registration, click "I AM NEW HERE"
If you already have account, click "I AM A MEMBER"

## Initial Set Up
On the first launch of your wallet you will get 24 words seed key. 

Find Your New Recovery Seed Key (aka Private Key)

### IMPORTANT NOTE
The new seed is the private key needed to retrieve your wallet when installing the app on a phone or setting up an online TF wallet (not yet available).

ThreeFold does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key. Do not share your seed it with anyone.
Without your 24-word private key, there is no way to access your TF wallet or TF tokens.
