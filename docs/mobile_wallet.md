## Initial setup
On the first launch of your wallet you will be asked to set your pin. It will be used later to access your wallet.

After setting up a pin, you will get your 24 words seed key. 

### IMPORTANT NOTE
The new seed is the private key needed to retrieve your wallet when installing the app on a phone or setting up an online TF wallet (not yet available).

ThreeFold does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key. Do not share your seed it with anyone.
Without your 24-word private key, there is no way to access your TF wallet or TF tokens.

Store your new 24-word recovery seed key in a safe place.
Suggestion - Write it down and store it safely offline.
If you were already using the app, your old 29-word seed key was automatically converted to a new seed key containing 24 words. It is of utmost importance to keep this backup key secret and safe!
