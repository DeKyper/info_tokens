# What are ThreeFold Tokens?

> ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold Network.

> A TFT represents a unit of reservation of autonomous Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Network. 

> The TFT economy is supported by the fastest growing commodity in the world, the internet.

## Farming

ThreeFold Tokens are generated through a process called farming.

Farming happens when internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.

Independent farmers earn ThreeFold Tokens by providing neutral and decentralized internet capacity, thus expending the usable Grid. Therefore no central entity controls the internet.

## Decentralized, Neutral & Secure

The ThreeFold Grid and ThreeFold Tokens are autonomous and decentralized making them neutral, energy efficient and secure.

## ThreeFold Capacity

ThreeFold Capacity can be used for anything, for instance for storage or computing power, which can be used for any workload.

## Tokens are only generated when capacity is added

ThreeFold Tokens are generated only when new IT capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.

No wasteful mining takes place and all farming is useable as internet capacity.

## Rivine

Rivine, ThreeFold's blockchain is a Proof of Blockstake protocol that powers the TFT.

A perfect platform for any financial transaction, especially suited for microtransactions, and it is endlessly scalable thanks to the farmers joining the Grid and the autonomous layer driving the ThreeFold Network.

## Transactions Fee

Very low, only one cent.

TFTs consume a fraction of the power of other platforms.
