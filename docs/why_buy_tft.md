# Why buy ThreeFold tokens?

ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency  used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the ThreeFold Network – generated only when active capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.

## Utility Driven

The ThreeFold Token is generated a result of adding active internet capacity. We call this process farming. The ThreeFold's blockchain is 100% energy efficient. The produced internet capacity uses up to 10 times less energy, it removes the need for centralized power-hungry data centers.

## Reliable & Secure

The ThreeFold Blockchain does not suffer from the “Blockchain Dilemma Problem”. Our blockchain is fast, scalable and secure at the same time, which is to date not possible with other blockchain technologies. This is a major breakthrough.
