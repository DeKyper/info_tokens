## Exchange BTC for ThreeFold tokens (TFT)

Currently we recommend exchanging your Bitcoin using [BTC-Alpha](#btc-alpha), they have two markets [BTC-TFT](https://btc-alpha.com/exchange/TFT_BTC/)

Follow the steps documented in [Using BTC-Alpha](/how_to_buy/btc-alpha.md).

> We do not recommend keeping ThreeFold tokens permanently on an online wallet, as provided by BTC-Alpha, because online exchanges are more likely to get hacked than offline wallets. Instead we highly recommended to keep your ThreeFold tokens in an offline ThreeFold wallet, such as the one provided with the ThreeFold App, see [Using the ThreeFold App](/threefold_aoo.md) for instructions.
