# Using BTC-Alpha

BTC-Alpha is the first online cryptocurrency exchange that supports ThreeFold tokens.

They actually offer following trading options: 
- [TFT-BTC](https://btc-alpha.com/exchange/TFT_BTC/)
- [TFT-USD](https://btc-alpha.com/exchange/TFT_USD/)

While BTC-Alpha supports buying ThreeFold tokens with USD (second option here above), we recommend that you first acquire Bitcoins as indicated in [Buy ThreeFold tokens from an online exchange](/how_to_buy/buy_from_exchange.md), and then exchange Bitcoins for ThreeFold tokens (the first option here above).

So once you have acquired Bitcoins, go through following steps to buy and sell ThreeFold tokens using BTC-Alpha:
- [Registration](#registration)
- [Login](#login)
- [Enable two-factor authentication](#two-factor)
- [Deposit BTC](#deposit-btc)
- [Exchange](#exchange-panel)
- [Buy TFT](#buy-tft)
- [Withdraw TFT](#withdraw)
- [Deposit TFT](#deposit-tft)

> As indicated here below in the section [Withdraw TFT](#withdraw), we highly recommend that you also install the [ThreeFold App](/threefold_app.md) in order to keep your ThreeFord tokens offline in your ThreeFold App wallet.
