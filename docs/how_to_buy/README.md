# How to buy ThreeFold tokens?

There are actually two options to buy ThreeFold tokens:
- [Buy from an online exchange](/how_to_buy/buy_from_exchange.md)
- [Buy directly from farmers or farmer cooperatives](/how_to_buy/buy_from_farmer.md)
- [Using BTC-Alpha](/how_to_buy/btc-alpha.md)
- [Using BITMEEX](/how_to_buy/bitmeex.md)
- [From Mazraa farm with credit card](/how_to_buy/mazraa.md)

For the actual steps click the above links or the links in the left navigation menu. 

> A third option will become available later this year, allowing you to buy and sell ThreeFold tokens on the **ThreeFold Decentralized Exchange**, based on the concept known as atomic swaps. Stay tuned.

Next to buying ThreeFold tokens, you can also earn ThreeFold tokens as a ThreeFold Farmer, as documented in the [ThreeFold Grid Wiki](https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/info_grid/#/).
