ThreeFold
ThreeFold Tokens can be bought from any of the ThreeFold Farmers or by means of Ripple, Ethereum or Bitcoin using the ThreeFold Exchange. The ThreeFold Grid launched at the end of March 2018 and the first group of ThreeFold Farmers agreed to sell Tokens at a price higher than US $0.10 per Token for at least the first month. This ensures a Token launching price of $0.10.  Please contact the ThreeFold Foundation if you would like to purchase ThreeFold asset-backed utility Tokens now, and we can point you to Farmers who are willing to sell.

### Utility Driven
The ThreeFold Token has tangible, intrinsic value as it is backed by the internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. 

“Utility” means that the ThreeFold Tokens can be used to buy and sell the internet capacity and/or products and services on the ThreeFold Grid. In this way, the Token’s value is supported by the intrinsic value of the ThreeFold Grid.

The community will have access to all metrics of the ThreeFold Grid required to determine its economic value.

### Economic value

Given the nature of the issuance model, amount of tokens issued by the grid to the new farmers are always smaller than the amount of real capacity connected to the Grid. 
Due to this fact, amount of tokens required to support liquidity on the market is growing faster, than the tokens available. As a result, with time every single token is getting more economic value behind.
