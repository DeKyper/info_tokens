# Token Issuance Economy

Given the nature of the issuance model, amount of tokens issued by the grid to the new farmers are always smaller than the amount of real capacity connected to the grid. 
Due to this fact, amount of tokens required to support liquidity on the market is growing faster, than the tokens available. As a result, with time every single token is getting more economic value behind.
