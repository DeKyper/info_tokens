# Token Goals Are Threefold:

**Utility** - The TFT is designed to have specific commercial utility as the designated currency for buying and selling IT Capacity on the TF Grid. 

**Green** - The ThreeFold Chain Operating System (Zero-OS) runs on a decentralized and distributed network of dedicated hyper-efficient Zero-Node (Node) infrastructure, which enables extreme scalability delivered at an extremely low carbon footprint.

**Neutral** - The ThreeFold Foundation is building a neutral and digitally responsible world by connecting humanity to a decentralized, distributed, neutral, and green internet owned by all of us. The ThreeFold Foundation does not have any shareholders and is not owned or controlled by any other corporation. The ThreeFold Foundation is only a promotion organization. All technology used by ThreeFold is open source. All users and ThreeFold Nodes are registered on a blockchain-based identity management platform enhancing security and privacy.  ​

The TF Chain has been built using our the Rivine.io blockchain stack. It is a distributed, “proof-of-stake” blockchain.  As a multi-chain platform, the TF Chain is not constrained in terms of scalability and slow transaction processing times as others are, and it does not consume huge  amounts of energy for mining purposes.

ThreeFold Tokens can be bought from any of the ThreeFold Farmers or by means of Ripple, Ethereum or Bitcoin using the TF Exchange. The TF Grid launched at the end of March 2018 and the first group of TF Farmers agreed to sell Tokens at a price higher than US $0.10 per Token for at least the first month. This ensures a Token launching price of $0.10.  Please contact the ThreeFold Foundation if you would like to purchase TF asset-backed utility Tokens now, and we can point you to Farmers who are willing to sell.






### Utility Driven
The ThreeFold Token has tangible, intrinsic value as it is backed by the internet capacity on the TF Grid. 

“Utility” means that the TF Tokens can be used to buy and sell the internet capacity and/or products and services on the TF Grid. In this way, the Token’s value is supported by the intrinsic value of the TF Grid.

The community will have access to all metrics of the TF Grid required to determine its economic value.
